                <h3>Objective</h3>
                <p>
                    This project analyzes <strong>Wish</strong>, a global e-commerce platform, through its summer 2020 product catalogue. 
                    The main goal is to understand whether Wish’s <strong>low-price strategy</strong> really pays off, how <strong>trustworthy</strong> the platform is, 
                    and whether it still needs additional <strong>advertising</strong> to grow.

                <p>
                    The dataset contains summer products sold on Wish in August 2020, including product information, prices, ratings, 
                    shipping coverage and advertising flags.

                    Using Python, I first checked for missing values and removed several columns with more than 90% nulls
                    (for example urgency banners and profile pictures). Then I created new features such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Price ranges</strong> (1–10 €, 11–20 €, 21–30 €, 31–49 €, 50+ €)</li>
                    <li><strong>Product categories</strong> based on keywords in the description</li>
                    <li><strong>Shipping reach</strong> (niche, popular, mainstream, global) based on number of countries</</li>
                    <li>Categorical versions of boolean fields like <em>uses_ads_boosts</em> and <em>shipping_is_express</em></li>

                <ul class="insights-list">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Low prices drive massive volume.</strong>  
                        Products in the <strong>1–10 €</strong> price range generated over <strong>5 million units sold</strong>, 
                        making this the most profitable tier in absolute terms.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Trust is built through reviews, not perfection.</strong>  
                        None of the top merchants reached a perfect 5/5 rating, but several achieved very high scores backed by 
                        <strong>100+ reviews</strong>, which indicates a generally reliable marketplace.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Price ≠ quality, but it helps.</strong>  
                        Higher-priced products tend to receive better ratings on average, but the cheapest items still perform surprisingly well, 
                        coming close to mid-range products in terms of customer satisfaction.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Global reach with a long tail of niche products.</strong>  
                        Products are shipped to between <strong>6 and 140 countries</strong>. Even though only a small group is truly “global” 
                        (100+ countries), niche and popular items also achieve strong sales.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Limited impact of ads.</strong>  
                        Only a small share of products use ads, and they do not show a clear advantage in either ratings or units sold, 
                        suggesting that advertising brings limited additional value in this snapshot of the platform.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                <p>
                    The analysis was guided by three key questions: <strong>Is Wish’s low-price strategy effective?</strong>, 
                    <strong>Can the platform be trusted?</strong>, and <strong>Does it still need more advertising?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The results show that the <strong>low-price strategy clearly works</strong>: most sales happen in the lowest price range, 
                    and customers are still fairly satisfied with these products. When it comes to trust, merchants with many reviews and 
                    good ratings provide a solid signal for buyers, even if no one reaches a perfect score.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, the platform appears to have already achieved <strong>strong global reach</strong>. Products are shipped worldwide, 
                    and advertising does not seem to significantly change performance in this dataset. This suggests that Wish is already in 
                    a <strong>mature stage</strong>, where organic visibility and price positioning play a bigger role than paid promotion.
                </p>
                <p class="next-steps">
                    <strong>Next Steps:</strong> a natural extension of this project would be to add predictive models for demand, 
                    or to build customer and product segments to support more targeted strategies.

                <h3>Recommendations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Expand express shipping</strong> to regions outside China to improve delivery speed and user experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Diversify product origins</strong> to include more non-Chinese manufacturers and increase perceived quality and trust.</li>
                    <li><strong>Introduce local warehouses</strong> in major regions (e.g. Europe, North America) to reduce shipping times and costs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Add clearer product categories</strong> instead of relying only on keyword search, improving navigation for new users.</li>
