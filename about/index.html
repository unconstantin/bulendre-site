                <div class="info-box">
        <p>
  If you ask a Romanian about <strong>“bulendre”</strong>, they’ll think of 
  bags of <strong>old clothes</strong>, not a catwalk. Now imagine the same 
  word said as if it were French. It almost becomes a <strong>chic brand</strong>! 
  You could picture it on a perfume bottle. 
  <strong>That gap</strong> between <strong>meaning</strong> and <strong>sound</strong> is why I chose it. 
  I’m less interested in the illusion around clothes and more in 
  <strong>what the data underneath actually shows</strong>.

    <h3>Project focus</h3>

    <div class="info-box">
        <p>
            I didn’t start with a grand plan to “fix” fashion. It began with a simple <strong>realisation:</strong> the way we make and buy clothes today is brand new in historical terms. For centuries, garments were built slowly, altered over time, and made for a specific person. Now, in only a few decades, we’ve normalised fast cycles, global supply chains, and closets full of items <strong>we barely wear.</strong>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-box">
        <p>
            I’m not trying to turn that past into a fairy tale, and I’m not interested in attacking specific companies. Some brands are clearly trying to change things. But <strong>the system</strong> as a whole still causes enormous <strong>harm</strong>. The old world won’t return, and there’s no point crying over an idealised version of it.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-box">
        <p>
            Since we can’t roll history back, I prefer to <strong>focus on</strong> what’s left in our hands: <strong>the data</strong> these systems produce every day. What we do have are the footprints this system leaves behind: prices, inventories, shipping routes, working hours, ratings, returns. All of that is data.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-box">
        <p>
            My focus is on <strong>using that data</strong>, with the skills I currently have, to ask small, concrete questions about how fashion works today and how it might work better tomorrow. <strong>Bulendre.org</strong> is where I document those questions and experiments, project by project, as a junior data analyst who believes that better information can support <strong>better decisions</strong>.
