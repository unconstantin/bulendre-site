    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>
        This project analyzes Wish, a global e-commerce platform, through its summer 2020 product catalogue. 
        The main goal is to understand whether Wish's low-price strategy really pays off, how trustworthy the platform is, 
        and whether it still needs additional advertising to grow.

                    The dataset contains summer products sold on Wish in August 2020, including product information, prices, ratings, 
                    shipping coverage and advertising flags.

                    (for example urgency banners and profile pictures). Then I created new features such as:

                                matters more than a perfect score.

                                of customer satisfaction. The relationship between price and perceived quality
                                is positive but not as strong as one might expect.

                                Only a small share of products use ads, and in this dataset they do not show
                                a strong advantage in either units sold or average rating. The lack of a clear gap
                                between advertised and non-advertised items suggests that product-level ads
                                may bring limited incremental value. Once users are on the platform, price appears
                                to be the main driver of choice, with ratings and ads playing only a secondary role.

                <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                <p>
    Finally, the platform appears to have already achieved strong global reach. Products are shipped worldwide, 
    and in this dataset advertised products do not significantly outperform non-advertised ones in terms of sales or ratings. 
    While this does not prove that ads are ineffective, it suggests that Wish may already be in a mature stage, where organic visibility 
    and price positioning play a bigger role than additional paid promotion.
</p>

                <p>
                    The results show that the <strong>low-price strategy clearly works</strong>: most sales happen in the lowest price range, 
                    and customers are still fairly satisfied with these products. When it comes to trust, merchants with many reviews and 
                    good ratings provide a solid signal for buyers, even if no one reaches a perfect score.
