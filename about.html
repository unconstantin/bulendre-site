                <h3>Why bulendre?</h3>
                <p>
                    If you ask a Romanian about “bulendre”, they’ll think of bags of old clothes, not a catwalk.
                    Now imagine the same word said as if it were French. It almost becomes a chic brand!
                    You could picture it on a perfume bottle. That gap between meaning and sound is why I chose it.
                    I’m less interested in the illusion around clothes and more in what the data underneath actually shows.

                <h3>Project Focus</h3>

                <p>
                    At some point I realised, to my surprise, that industrial clothing is a very recent chapter in our history.
                    Over time, new technology and the economic pressure to produce more, faster, and cheaper pushed clothing
                    out of the tailor’s hands and into mass-production systems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Not long ago, it was normal to choose a fabric, go to a tailor, and build a wardrobe over time that truly
                    suited your life. Tailors haven’t disappeared, but the price difference compared to mass-produced clothing
                    means they’re rarely the first long-term option people think of.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I even had a phase where I wanted to make my own clothes, and as I looked into it I kept coming back to the
                    same thought: somewhere along the way, something changed dramatically.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I carry a lot of open questions about fashion today, and my mission here is to slowly uncover what happened
                    in between. Bulendre.org is the place where I try to explore those questions using the data analysis skills I
                    learned through Wawiwa’s program. It’s a practical space for me to apply what I’m learning and to develop,
                    project by project, as a junior data analyst.
